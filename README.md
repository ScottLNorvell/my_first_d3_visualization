# My First d3 Visualization

#### You always remember your first...

This code is based on OMG particles found [here](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/1062544).

In this exercise, I played around with rendering multiple particles. The result started looking like smoke, so I altered the colors to match, and randomized the dispersion. I thought it looked a little like the Smoke Monster from Lost, so I changed the background to green, and there you have it!
